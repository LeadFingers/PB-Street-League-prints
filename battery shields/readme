The purpose of these battery shields is to primarily protect the battery's from damage and secondarily to equalize the weight of different batteries
the battery pad is installed on the battery shield itself and not on the drone frame
the cut out is for the battery strap to directly contact the battery
The shield stays on the drone and the batteries easily slide in and out of it, you only need 1

shields should be printed with enough walls to ensure that the back surface where the battery pad will be installed has ZERO infill, I use 4 walls.
this is to prevent the battery from rocking around and introducing noise into your gyro

You can use these shields to equalize the weight between batteries so that the battery + shield total weight is always the same
My pyrodrone batteries are 15g heavier than my GNB batteries. So I chose to have my pyrodrone battery shield weigh 66g and my GNB battery shield weigh 81g.
to determine the weight of your print slice the file in CURA with no supports, bed adhesion, etc. 
then adjust your infill percentage until you hit your desired weight before adding supports, bed adhesion, etc. back in to do the print

if you would like a shield made for your batteries please contact me on the Street League discord server ( https://discord.gg/rqGfKBbYbP ) and @LeadFingers to find me
